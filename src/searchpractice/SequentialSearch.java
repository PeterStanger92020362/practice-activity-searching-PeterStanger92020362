/**
 * The class SequentialSearch provides a framework for implementing 
 * a sequential search algorithm, also known as linear search, on a collection
 * of integers given as input.
 * 
 * Searching in collections is done to answer the following questions: 
 * - Does the element exists in a collection? -> method contains()
 * - How to get the element from a collection? - > method indexOf()
 *
 * "Collection" in this class is used in the broader sense 
 * and not in the strict Java sense. For example a collection may be an array 
 * or a list
